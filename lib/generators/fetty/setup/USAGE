  with necessary gem need for you to build your rails app.
  the basic installation required you to have :
	- meta_search
	- simple_form
	- will_paginate
	- jquery-rails
  and the optional gems for Authentication & Autorization using :
	- Devise
	- CanCan

   this default command will add gems to your Gemfile and install
   some necessary files. both required and optional gems.
   if you like to install minimum for layout and scaffolding using

   or authorization you could skip the optional setup :

    rails generate fetty:setup --skip-optional
