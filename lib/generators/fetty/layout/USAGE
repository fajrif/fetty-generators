Description:
	The fetty:layout generator creates a basic layout, stylesheet and
	helper which will give some structure to a starting Rails app.

	The generator takes one argument which will be the name of the
	application layout and stylesheet files. If no argument is passed then it defaults
	to "application.html.erb".

	The helper module includes some methods which can be called in any
	template or partial to set variables to be used in the layout, such as
	"title".
	
	Optional "links" will includes in generating your layout, such as 
	"authentications links" or "mailboxes links"
	
Examples:
    rails g fetty:layout

	rails g fetty:layout --auth-links --mailbox-links
