Description:
  The fetty:layout generator creates a basic layout, stylesheet and
  helper which will give some structure to a starting Rails app.

  The generator takes one argument which will be the name of the
	layout and stylesheet files. If no argument is passed then it defaults
	to "application".

  The helper module includes some methods which can be called in any
  template or partial to set variables to be used in the layout, such as
  page title, javascript/stylesheet and also includes Devise SignIn and SignUp 
  link buttons.

Examples:
    rails g fetty:layout

        Layout:     app/views/layouts/application.html.erb
        Stylesheet: public/stylesheets/application.css
        Helper:     app/helpers/layout_helper.rb
